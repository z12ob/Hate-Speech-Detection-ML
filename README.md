# Hate Speech Detection ML

A machine learning project for detecting hate speech in social media posts using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a hate speech detection system that classifies tweets into three categories:
- **Hate Speech** (Class 0)
- **Offensive Language** (Class 1) 
- **Normal** (Class 2)

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a Twitter dataset (`twitter.csv`) containing 24,783 tweets with labeled classifications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **NLTK** - Natural language processing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
